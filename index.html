<td align="left"><p>In this work, a pressure-actuated soft manipulator for the single section is designed and fabricated. The component unit of the prototype is the pneumatic muscle actuators (PMA), made by covering the surface of the silicone rubber tube with the nylon mesh. A pneumatic connector from baseplate is directly plugged into the silicone rubber tube to control the flow of air. The annular groove on the surface of the pneumatic connector prevents it from falling off under pressure, and the outside is tightly sealed with the help of the nylon ties to further ensure air tightness. Each PMA has an individual chamber as the pressure control channel, which can extend up to 200% and withstand 0 to 3 bar pressure range. Three identical PMAs, distributed symmetrically in parallel, are circumferentially connected to actuate the prototype together. Besides, the gaps between PMAs are tightly fixed by the braided thread and nylon ties to ensure the prototype’s shape is as close as possible to the feature of constant curvature. The actuator configuration designed can bend in any direction.<br />
Another bold attempt is to add a steering engine between the two sections of the soft manipulator. This rotatable design between sections can increase the additional degree of freedom of the prototype, and it is hoped to decouple the control of the bending direction and bending shape of the second section of the soft manipulator. This innovative design is also trying to integrate into my research. <br />

The kinematics model for single section is proposed under the assumption of piecewise constant curvature theory, converting the length variables to the space pose.  Then the single section model is extended to the multi-section model based on the novel D-H method, which obtains the posture of  the whole manipulator. Finally, the reasonability of the shape detection system is verified respectively from theory and experiment, and the experiment results agree well with the simulation results in real time.<br />
